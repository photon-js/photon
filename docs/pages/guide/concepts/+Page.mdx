Photon is a next-generation server toolkit designed primarily for **library and framework developers** who need universal server capabilities.

## Philosophy

Photon follows these core principles:

### Universal Server Support

Unlike other solutions that lock you into specific frameworks, Photon works with **any** server framework:

- **Hono** - Ultrafast web framework for edge runtimes
- **Express** - The most popular Node.js web framework
- **Fastify** - High-performance web framework
- **Elysia** - Bun-optimized framework with end-to-end type safety
- **H3** - Minimal and modern web framework
- **HatTip** - Universal web framework built on Web Standards

### Deploy Anywhere

Write once, deploy anywhere. Photon applications can be deployed to:

- **Edge Runtimes**: Cloudflare Workers, Vercel Edge, Netlify Edge
- **Serverless**: AWS Lambda, Vercel Functions, Netlify Functions
- **Traditional Servers**: Node.js, Docker, VPS
- **Static Hosting**: GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel (for SSG)

### Vite-Powered

Built on top of Vite's Environment API, Photon provides:

- **Hot Module Replacement** for server code
- **Fast builds** with Vite's optimized bundling
- **Rich ecosystem** compatibility with Vite plugins
- **TypeScript** support out of the box

## Architecture

Photon's architecture consists of three main components:

### Core (`@photonjs/core`)

The foundation that provides:
- Vite plugin integration
- Configuration management
- Virtual module system
- Build orchestration

### Server Adapters

Framework-specific adapters that handle:
- Universal middleware application
- Server lifecycle management
- Runtime-specific optimizations

### Deployment Adapters

Platform-specific adapters for:
- Build output optimization
- Runtime environment setup
- Platform-specific features

## Key Features

### Server Code Splitting

Each page and API route can be deployed as a separate function:

```ts
// Each route becomes its own deployable unit
export default {
  entries: {
    'api/users': './src/api/users.ts',
    'api/posts': './src/api/posts.ts',
    'pages/dashboard': './src/pages/dashboard.ts'
  }
}
```

### Universal Middleware

Write middleware once, use everywhere:

```ts
// Works across all server frameworks
const authMiddleware = createUniversalMiddleware((context) => {
  // Universal middleware logic
})
```

### Type Safety

Full TypeScript support with intelligent inference:

```ts
// Automatic type inference across the stack
const config = photon({
  server: './src/server.ts', // Types inferred
  entries: {
    'api/users': './src/api/users.ts' // Route types generated
  }
})
```

## Comparison

| Feature | Photon | Nitro | Next.js |
|---------|--------|-------|---------|
| Server Framework | Any | H3 only | Built-in |
| Deployment Targets | Universal | Universal | Vercel-focused |
| Architecture | Modular | Monolithic | Monolithic |
| Framework Lock-in | None | Minimal | High |
| Edge Runtime | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Code Splitting | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |

## When to Use Photon

### For Framework Developers

Photon is ideal when building:

- **Universal web frameworks** that work across runtimes
- **Server-agnostic libraries** and tools
- **Platform-agnostic solutions** for diverse deployment needs
- **Developer tools** that need maximum compatibility

### For Advanced Users

Direct usage is suitable when you need:

- **Maximum flexibility** in architectural decisions
- **Multi-runtime support** without framework lock-in
- **Custom deployment strategies** across platforms
- **Integration** with existing complex systems

### For End Users

If you're building applications rather than frameworks, consider using frameworks built with Photon:

- **[Vike](https://vike.dev)** - Fast Vite-based framework with Photon under the hood
- **Other Photon-powered frameworks** - Check the ecosystem for more options

These frameworks provide the benefits of Photon's universal deployment while offering the developer experience optimized for application development.

## Photon Ecosystem

### Frameworks Built with Photon

- **[Vike](https://vike.dev)** - Fast Vite-based framework with flexible architecture
- **More coming soon** - The ecosystem is growing as Photon matures

### Success Stories

Frameworks using Photon benefit from:
- **Universal deployment** - Deploy to any platform without framework changes
- **Server flexibility** - Choose the best server framework for each use case
- **Future-proof architecture** - Adapt to new runtimes and platforms easily
