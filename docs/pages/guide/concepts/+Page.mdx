Photon is designed as an **unopinionated and flexible alternative to [Nitro](https://nitro.build/)**, with support for universal server capabilities.

## Philosophy

Photon follows these core principles:

### Universal Server Support

Unlike other solutions that lock you into specific frameworks, Photon works with **any** server framework:

- **Hono** - Ultrafast web framework for edge runtimes
- **Express** - The most popular Node.js web framework
- **Fastify** - High-performance web framework
- **Elysia** - Bun-optimized framework with end-to-end type safety
- **H3** - Minimal and modern web framework
- **Hattip** - Universal web framework built on Web Standards

### Deploy Anywhere

Write once, deploy anywhere. Photon applications can be deployed to:

- **Edge Runtimes**: Cloudflare Workers, Vercel Edge, Netlify Edge (coming soon)
- **Serverless**: Vercel Functions, Netlify Functions (coming soon), AWS Lambda (coming soon)
- **Traditional Servers**: Node.js, Docker, VPS
- **Static Hosting**: GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel (for SSG)

### Vite-Powered

Built on top of Vite's Environment API, Photon provides:

- **Hot Module Replacement** for server code
- **Fast builds** with Vite's optimized bundling
- **Rich ecosystem** compatibility with Vite plugins

## Key Features

### Server Code Splitting

Each page and API route can be deployed as a separate function:

```ts
// Each route becomes its own deployable unit
export default {
  entries: {
    'api/users': './src/api/users.ts',
    'api/posts': './src/api/posts.ts',
    'pages/dashboard': './src/pages/dashboard.ts'
  }
}
```

### Universal Middleware

Write middleware once, use everywhere:

```ts
// Works across all server frameworks
const authMiddleware = createUniversalMiddleware((context) => {
  // Universal middleware logic
})
```
