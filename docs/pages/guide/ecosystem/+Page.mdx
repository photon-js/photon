> ⚠️ **Alpha Stage**: The Photon ecosystem is growing as the project matures.

Discover frameworks and tools built with Photon.

## Frameworks

### Vike

**[Vike](https://vike.dev)** is a fast Vite-based framework that uses Photon under the hood.

**Features:**
- **Flexible architecture** - Choose your own view library (React, Vue, Solid, etc.)
- **Universal deployment** - Deploy to any platform thanks to Photon
- **Fast development** - Vite-powered with instant HMR
- **Server flexibility** - Works with any server framework

**Getting Started:**
```bash
npm create vike@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

**Why Vike uses Photon:**
- Universal deployment without vendor lock-in
- Server framework flexibility for different use cases
- Future-proof architecture that adapts to new runtimes

### More Frameworks Coming Soon

The Photon ecosystem is growing. Framework developers are building on Photon to provide:
- **Universal deployment** capabilities
- **Server framework flexibility**
- **Multi-runtime support**
- **Future-proof architecture**

## Success Stories

### Why Frameworks Choose Photon

**Universal Deployment:**
Frameworks built with Photon can deploy to any platform without additional configuration or vendor-specific code.

**Server Flexibility:**
Users can choose the best server framework for their specific needs - from ultrafast edge runtimes to traditional Node.js servers.

**Future-Proof:**
As new runtimes and platforms emerge, Photon-based frameworks automatically gain support without breaking changes.

**Developer Experience:**
Photon's Vite integration provides excellent development experience with HMR for server code.
