> ⚠️ **Alpha Stage**: Photon is currently in alpha. APIs may change before stable release.

Photon is a next-generation server toolkit designed for **library and framework developers** who need universal server capabilities.

## Who is Photon for?

Photon is primarily designed for:

- **Framework developers** building universal web frameworks
- **Library authors** creating server-agnostic tools
- **Platform builders** needing multi-runtime support
- **Advanced developers** who want maximum flexibility

If you're looking to build a simple web app, consider using frameworks built with Photon like [Vike](https://vike.dev) instead.

## Installation

Install Photon core and choose a server adapter:

```bash
# Core package
npm install @photonjs/core

# Choose a server adapter
npm install @photonjs/hono        # Recommended for edge runtimes
npm install @photonjs/express     # For Node.js applications
npm install @photonjs/fastify     # For high-performance apps
```

### Basic Configuration

```ts
// vite.config.ts
import { photon } from '@photonjs/core/vite'

export default {
  plugins: [
    photon({
      server: './src/server.ts'
    })
  ]
}
```

### Create Your Server

Choose your preferred server framework. This example shows how to create a universal server that works across runtimes:

#### With Hono (Recommended)

```ts
// src/server.ts
import { Hono } from 'hono'
import { apply, serve } from '@photonjs/hono'

const app = new Hono()

app.get('/', (c) => c.text('Hello Photon!'))

apply(app)
export default serve(app)
```

#### With Express

```ts
// src/server.ts
import express from 'express'
import { apply, serve } from '@photonjs/express'

const app = express()

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello Photon!')
})

apply(app)
export default serve(app)
```

#### With Fastify

```ts
// src/server.ts
import Fastify from 'fastify'
import { apply, serve } from '@photonjs/fastify'

const app = Fastify()

app.get('/', async () => {
  return { message: 'Hello Photon!' }
})

apply(app)
export default serve(app)
```

## Development

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your app will be available at `http://localhost:3000` with hot module replacement.

## Building

Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Building a Framework

If you're building a framework with Photon, consider:

1. **Universal middleware** - Create middleware that works across all server adapters
2. **Runtime detection** - Handle different deployment targets gracefully
3. **Type safety** - Leverage Photon's TypeScript support
4. **Documentation** - Help your users understand deployment options
