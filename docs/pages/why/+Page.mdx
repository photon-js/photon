We believe Photon represents the future of JavaScript server integration and deployment.

- **For users:** use any server (Hono, Express.js, Fastify, ...) and deploy anywhere (Cloudflare, Vercel, Netlify, self-hosted, ...).
- **For frameworks:** easy and incremental Photon integration, with optional <Link href="#collaboration">tight-knit collaboration</Link>.
- **For deployment providers:** add first-class integration to multiple frameworks at once, with optional <Link href="#collaboration">tight-knit collaboration</Link>.


## Features

Photon is jam-packed with features:
- **Any server**:
  [Hono](https://hono.dev/),
  [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/),
  [Elysia](https://elysiajs.com/),
  [Fastify](https://fastify.dev/),
  [H3](https://h3.dev/),
  [Srvx](https://srvx.h3.dev/),
  [Hattip](https://github.com/hattipjs/hattip).
- **Any deployment**: Cloudflare, Vercel, self-hosting (e.g. AWS and VPS), and more is work-in-progress.
- **HMR**: No more full server reload required.
- **Vite Environment API**: Develop against the same runtime as production (e.g. Cloudflare's `workerd` runtime).
- **Code-splitting**: Per-route deployment to separate edge workers.
- **Zero-config**: Deploy with minimal configuration.
- **TypeScript**: First-class TypeScript support.

### HMR

Server-side HMR means that, if you change a server file, the server code is automatically updated: the next HTTP response will be generated by the updated code. No more full server reload required.

> This is experimental and doesn't always work: Photon sometimes still triggers a full server reload.

If HMR isn't what you want (for example if you modify the database connection) you can manually trigger a full server reload by pressing `r + enter`.

### Code-splitting

To reduce cold starts, Photon supports server-side code splitting: each page has its own production bundle — each bundle is minimal and contains only what is needed to render that page.

This means you can scale to hundreds of pages while keeping you server cold starts low.

### Vite Environment API

Photon's Cloudflare integration uses [`@cloudflare/vite-plugin`](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-the-cloudflare-vite-plugin/), which runs the server-side of the user's app inside `workerd` — the same runtime Cloudflare Workers uses in production.

This means the development environment is now a faithful representation of Cloudflare's production edge environment.

> It's powered by [Vite's Environment API](https://vike.dev/blog/vite-6), which enables Vite to run in a Node.js process while running the user's server code in another (non-Node.js) process such as `workerd`.


## Philosophy

### Collaboration

Tight-knit collaboration is key for a thriving ecosystem:
- **Framework authors:** we work with frameworks, pushing the envelope of what's possible.
- **Deployment providers:** we work with deployment providers for first-class, full-fledged deployment integrations.

### Clear separation of concerns

Photon is hyper-focused on being a shared server and deployment infrastructure — we don't re-implement features that are already handled by servers and frameworks.

As a framework or deployment provider, you preserve full control over what makes your framework/deployment special.

We use and advocate for web standards fostering interoperability.
