We believe Photon represents the future of JavaScript server & deployment infrastructure:

- **For users:** use any server (Hapi, Express.js, Fastify, <Link href="/guide/server-frameworks">and more</Link>) and deploy anywhere (Cloudflare, Netlify, Vercel, self-hosted, <Link href="/guide/deploy">and more</Link>).
- **For frameworks:** easy Photon integration, with optional <Link href="#collaboration">tight-knit collaboration</Link> with the Photon team.
- **For deployment providers:** add <Link href="#collaboration">first-class integration</Link> to multiple frameworks at once.


## Features

Photon is jam-packed with features:
- HMR


## Philosophy

### Collaboration

We believe in tight-knit collaborations for a thriving ecosystem:
- **Framework authors.** We work closely with frameworks, pushing the envelope of what's possible.
- **Deployment providers.** We partner with deployment providers for first-class, full-fledged deployment integrations.

### Clear separation of concerns

Photon is hyper-focused on server and deployment infrastructure — we don't implement features handled by servers or frameworks.

### Open

We use and advocate web standards to foster interoperability that benefits everyone.

Photon's flexible architecture doesn't restrict frameworks or deployment providers.

### Transparent

Photon's partners are public, and our financial support comes from multiple deployment providers — avoiding dependency on a single sponsor.
