We believe Photon represents the future of JavaScript server and deployment infrastrucure:

- **For users:** use any server (Hapi, Express.js, Fastify, <Link href="/guide/server-frameworks">and more</Link>) and deploy anywhere (self-hosted, Cloudflare, Netlify, Vercel, <Link href="/guide/deploy">and more</Link>).
- **For frameworks:** easy Photon integration, to provide users with all the <Link href="#features">Photon features</Link>.
- **For deployment providers:** add first-class integration to multiple frameworks at once.


## Features

Photon is packed with features:
- HMR


## Leadership

### Governance

Photon is open and collaborative, and welcomes tight-knit partnerships with framework authors and deployment providers — pushing the envelope of what's possible.

### Transparency

Photon is financially sustainable, with financial support coming from mulitple deployment providers (avoiding financial dependency on one single deployment provider). We partner with deployment providers for a tight-knit collaboration for first-class integrations (in a way that any deployment provider can benefit from).

### Architecture

Photon is both minimal and full-fledged.
- Minimal: 
- Full-fledged
- **Hyper-focused** on server and deployment infrastrucure — we don't implement features that should be implemented by servers or frameworks.

with a clear separation of concern with servers and frameworks.
